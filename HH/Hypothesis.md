Hypothesis:
    blocking glucose transport causes decreased excitability
    decreased excitability occurs due to increased threshold
    more sodium in cell due to reduced pump activity
    Ena approaches Vm
    pump activity decreases due to lack of atp
    because of decreased glucose

Temporal order:
    1) Blocked glucose transport (WZB 17)
        GLUT 4 > 1&3
    *2) Less glucose in cell
    *3) less atp
    *4) Less pump activity
    *5) More sodium in the cell
    *6) Ena approaches Vm
    7) increased threshold
    *8) cell is less excitable


Exp A: is cell less excitable?
 - inject current ramp before and after drug, measure first spike time (current)
 - if first spike is earlier:
   - can we reject the hypothesis? yes*
 - else:
   - can we confirm the hypothesis? no*
 - issues with experiment:
   - whole cell: ATP is being buffered/supplied by pipette
    - access changing <- can test this
   - perforated: hard to make a long enough recording (cell dying, current delivery unstable)
    - going whole cell
   - sharp: hard to do
   - concentration of drug/expense, ethanol
    - puffing
 - no within-cell control
  - statistical test: effect size (mean difference, over the variance) and N
  - do a power analysis

Exp B: does Ena approach Vm
 - perforated, with/out drug
 - voltage clamp: what voltage eliminates sodium current?
 - need: TEA, CoCl2, ... K+, Ca++ blockers
 - or: TTX
 - issue: how quickly does sodium equilibrate with pipette?
 - if Ena approaches Vm:
   - can we confirm the hypothesis? no
 - else:
   - can we reject the hypothesis? yes*

Exp C: does intracellular ATP decrease:
 - iATPsnfr
 - ATP-selective electrode?

Exp D: do changes mirror anoxia?
 - indirect

Exp E: intracellular [Na]:
  - ion-selective microelectrode (sharp?)
